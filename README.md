## How's it made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

- I learnt how to use `event.target` to identify which button I clicked. More specifically I used the event.target.id to find retreive the button's id for a function.
- more practice using arrays, and to `.push` new items in it.
- Also good practice getting info from objects.
